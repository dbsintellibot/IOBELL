## 1. Getting Started

The AutoBell system consists of three parts:
- **The Physical Bell Device:** Installed in your school, connected to speakers and WiFi.
- **The Web Dashboard:** Used on a computer to set up schedules.
- **The Mobile App:** Used by staff to ring bells manually or trigger emergencies.

## 2. Web Dashboard

Access the dashboard at: `https://your-autobell-dashboard-url.com` (Ask your IT admin for the link).

### Logging In
1. Enter your school email and password.
2. If you forgot your password, contact the administrator.

### Managing Bell Schedules
