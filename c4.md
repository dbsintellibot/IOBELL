# Prompt: IoT Firmware - WiFi Manager Implementation

**Context:**
The ESP32 firmware currently has hardcoded WiFi credentials (`YOUR_WIFI_SSID`). This makes deployment difficult. We need to implement a WiFi Manager that allows users to configure WiFi credentials via a captive portal.

**Task:**
1.  **Dependencies:**
    *   Update `esp32-firmware/platformio.ini` to include a WiFi Manager library (e.g., `tzapu/WiFiManager` or similar compatible with ESP32).

2.  **Implementation (`esp32-firmware/src/main.cpp`):**
    *   Replace the hardcoded `WiFi.begin()` logic.
    *   Initialize the WiFi Manager.
    *   Configure it to start an Access Point (AP) named "AutoBell-Setup" if it cannot connect to a saved network.
    *   On successful connection, continue with the normal setup (Supabase connection, etc.).

3.  **User Experience:**
    *   Ensure the device prints the IP address to the Serial Monitor after connection.
    *   (Optional) If possible, allow setting a "Device Name" or "School ID" via custom parameters in the WiFi Manager portal, saving it to non-volatile storage (Preferences or LittleFS).
