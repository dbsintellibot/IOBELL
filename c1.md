# Prompt: Web Dashboard - Implement Write Operations

**Context:**
The `web-dashboard` is currently a visual prototype. It displays UI for managing audio and profiles but relies on mock data or lacks the final "save" functionality. We need to connect these forms to the Supabase backend.

**Task:**
1.  **Audio Manager (`web-dashboard/src/pages/AudioManager.tsx`):**
    *   Implement the "Upload Audio" functionality.
    *   Use the Supabase JS client to upload the file to the `audio_files` storage bucket.
    *   After a successful upload, insert a record into the `audio_files` database table with the file metadata (name, url, duration, etc.).
    *   Refresh the list after upload.

2.  **Profile Editor (`web-dashboard/src/pages/ProfileEditor.tsx`):**
    *   Implement the "Save Profile" functionality.
    *   Collect the profile name and the list of schedule items (bells) from the state.
    *   Perform an `upsert` (or insert/update) operation to the `profiles` table.
    *   Save the associated schedule items to the `schedules` table (handling deletions/updates of existing items).
    *   Add proper loading states and success/error notifications (using a toast component or `alert` for now).
