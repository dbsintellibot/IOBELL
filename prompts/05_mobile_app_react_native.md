# Sub-Prompt 5: Mobile App (React Native)

**Goal:** Build the Mobile App for School Operators (Android/iOS).

**Instructions:**
1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Initialize a React Native project using **Expo** (TypeScript).
    *   Install dependencies: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `react-navigation`.

2.  **Authentication:**
    *   Login screen (email/password).
    *   Persistent session handling (AsyncStorage).

3.  **Core Features (Simplified):**
    *   **Dashboard:** View next bell time and active profile.
    *   **Manual Trigger:** Button to manually ring a specific bell/audio.
    *   **Emergency:** Big Red Button for emergency broadcast.
    *   **Profile Switcher:** Quickly change today's profile (e.g., Switch from "Normal" to "Rainy Day").

4.  **Offline & Performance:**
    *   Ensure the app loads quickly on low-end Android devices.
    *   Cache basic data (school name, list of bells) locally.

**Output:**
*   Expo project setup instructions.
*   Screen components code.
*   Navigation setup.
